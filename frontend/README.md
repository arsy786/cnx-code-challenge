# Frontend

This README is specifically for frontend-related tasks. For instructions on running the full-stack application, please refer to the main project `README.md` in the root directory.

## Scripts

Below are the available scripts for the frontend. Run these commands from the `frontend` directory:

### Development Mode

Start the Vite development server to run the app in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the app at `http://localhost:3001` (or another port if configured)

### Build the Application

Build the project for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a production-ready version of your app in the dist directory.

### Preview the App

Preview the production build locally before deploying it:

```bash
npm run preview
```

### Linting

Run ESLint to identify code quality and style issues:

```bash
npm run lint
```
